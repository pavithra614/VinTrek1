## Usage

### Integration with VinTrek App

The enhanced booking form integrates seamlessly with the existing VinTrek application:

```html
<!-- In vinTrekApp.html -->
<c-enhanced-booking-form 
    campsite-id={selectedCampsiteId}
    trail-id={selectedTrailId}
    camping-item-ids={cartItemIds}
    onbookingcreated={handleBookingCreated}>
</c-enhanced-booking-form>
```

### Booking Flow Steps

1. **User selects campsite and rental items** from the VinTrek interface
2. **Booking form opens** with pre-populated data
3. **User fills booking details** (dates, people, special requests)
4. **Weather check automatically runs** based on location and dates
5. **Payment gateway displays** with multiple payment options
6. **Booking confirmation** shows success message and booking details

## Key Features

### Cart Management

- Calculate total costs including taxes and fees
- Real-time price updates based on duration

### Weather Alerts

## Configuration

### Weather Service Setup
The WeatherService class provides mock weather data. To integrate with a real weather API:

1. Update the `getWeatherForecast` method in `WeatherService.cls`
2. Add external service configuration in Salesforce Setup
3. Configure proper API credentials and endpoints

### Payment Gateway Integration
The checkout form includes mock payment processing. For real payment integration:

1. Choose a payment provider (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
2. Update the payment processing methods in `checkoutForm.js`
3. Add proper API credentials and security measures
4. Implement server-side payment validation

## Styling and Theming

The components use Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) with custom enhancements:

- **Color Scheme**: VinTrek brand colors with SLDS base
- **Typography**: Salesforce Sans font family
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Icons**: Lightning utility icons throughout
- **Spacing**: Consistent SLDS spacing tokens

## Browser Support

- Chrome 70+
- Firefox 65+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of weather data
- Optimized animations using CSS transforms
- Minimal DOM manipulation
- Efficient event handling
- Proper loading states to prevent user confusion

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Availability**: Live availability checking
2. **Advanced Weather**: Detailed weather forecasts with maps
3. **Payment Options**: Additional payment methods and currencies
4. **Booking Modifications**: Edit/cancel booking functionality
5. **Email Notifications**: Automated booking confirmations
6. **Calendar Integration**: Add to calendar functionality
7. **Reviews Integration**: Post-booking review collection

## Testing

The enhanced booking flow should be tested with:

1. **Different screen sizes** - Mobile, tablet, desktop
2. **Various booking scenarios** - Single/multiple items, different durations
3. **Weather conditions** - With and without alerts
4. **Payment methods** - All supported payment options
5. **Error handling** - Network failures, validation errors
6. **Accessibility** - Screen readers, keyboard navigation

## Deployment

Deploy the enhanced booking flow using Salesforce CLI:
